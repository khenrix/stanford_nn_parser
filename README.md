# TDDE09 - Natural Language Processing 
## Project name: Trump or Slump (Title in progress..)
## Abstract
This project is part of the course TDDE09, Natural Language Processing.  
The main goal of the project is to analyze text and tag it according to the context of the text.  
Data for training and evaluation will be gathered from [twitter](https://www.twitter.com) and text will be classified as either true or false.  
The main person of interest will be the president of the United States [Donald J. Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump).  
By looking at the tweets made by the president the goal is to be able to classify any tweet as written by trump or a not.  
Trump has total of 35'000 tweets which should be sufficent for training and evaluation.  
Tweets made by other people using the hashtag "#trump" will also be used as examples for non-Trump tweets.
